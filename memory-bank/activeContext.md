# Active Context: Component-Based Testing Implementation

## Current Work Focus
Building a component-based testing architecture to replace the current tightly-coupled test structure with reusable, maintainable components.

## Recent Analysis
- Reviewed `tests/functional/chat-module.spec.ts` which shows current testing patterns
- Identified complex CSS selectors and repeated UI interaction logic
- Found sequential test execution with shared browser context
- Observed lack of reusable component abstractions

## Next Steps
1. **Create Base Component Directory**: Set up `src/framework/components/base/`
2. **Implement Generic Components**: Build Button, TextField, Tab, Checkbox, Dropdown components
3. **Create Composed Components**: Build ChatComponent using base components
4. **Refactor Existing Test**: Update chat-module.spec.ts to use new components
5. **Validate Architecture**: Test the new component-based approach

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Component Architecture Decisions
- **Two-tier system**: Base components (generic) + Composed components (feature-specific)
- **Locator encapsulation**: Hide CSS selectors within components
- **Parameter-driven**: Components accept configuration for different scenarios
- **Consistent API**: Standardized method names across all components

### Implementation Priorities
1. **Button Component**: Most commonly used UI element
2. **TextField Component**: Essential for input interactions
3. **ChatComponent**: Primary feature component for refactoring
4. **Gradual Migration**: Maintain existing tests while building new structure

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Naming Conventions
- Base components: `[ElementType].component.ts` (e.g., `button.component.ts`)
- Composed components: `[FeatureName].component.ts` (e.g., `chat.component.ts`)
- Class names: PascalCase (e.g., `Button`, `ChatComponent`)

### Method Patterns
- Actions: `click()`, `fill()`, `select()`
- Assertions: `toBeVisible()`, `toHaveText()`, `toBeEnabled()`
- Composite actions: `clickAndWait()`, `fillAndSubmit()`

### Error Handling
- Components should handle element waiting automatically
- Provide meaningful error messages for debugging
- Support timeout configuration for different scenarios

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Current Pain Points
- CSS selectors like `div.flex.w-full.items-center.bg-white.dark\\:bg-\\[\\#1E1E1E\\]...` are brittle
- Test logic is scattered across multiple test methods
- No standardized way to interact with similar UI elements
- Difficult to maintain when UI structure changes

### Benefits of Component Approach
- **Reusability**: Same Button component works across all features
- **Maintainability**: Change selector in one place, affects all tests
- **Readability**: Tests become more declarative and business-focused
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new components and features

### Integration with Existing Framework
- Components will work alongside existing Page Object Model
- Utility classes remain unchanged
- Configuration management stays the same
- Global setup/teardown patterns preserved
