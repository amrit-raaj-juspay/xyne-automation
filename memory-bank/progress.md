# Progress: Component-Based Testing Implementation

## What Works (Completed)
- ✅ **Memory Bank Established**: Complete documentation structure created
- ✅ **Project Analysis**: Reviewed existing test structure and identified improvement areas
- ✅ **Architecture Design**: Defined two-tier component system (base + composed)
- ✅ **Implementation Plan**: Clear roadmap for component creation and migration

## What's Left to Build

### Phase 1: Base Components (In Progress)
- [ ] **Button Component**: Generic button interactions and assertions
- [ ] **TextField Component**: Input field handling (text, contenteditable)
- [ ] **Tab Component**: Tab navigation and state management
- [ ] **Checkbox Component**: Checkbox selection and verification
- [ ] **Dropdown Component**: Select/dropdown interactions

### Phase 2: Composed Components
- [ ] **ChatComponent**: Chat interface using base components
- [ ] **LoginComponent**: Authentication flow component
- [ ] **NavigationComponent**: Header and navigation elements
- [ ] **SearchComponent**: Search functionality component

### Phase 3: Test Migration
- [ ] **Refactor chat-module.spec.ts**: Update to use new components
- [ ] **Create example tests**: Demonstrate component usage patterns
- [ ] **Update documentation**: Component usage guides

## Current Status
**Phase**: Memory Bank Setup ✅ → Base Component Creation (Starting)

**Next Immediate Actions**:
1. Create `src/framework/components/base/` directory
2. Implement Button component with comprehensive API
3. Implement TextField component for various input types
4. Create ChatComponent using base components
5. Refactor one test file to validate approach

## Known Issues
- None currently identified

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial State
- Tests directly used Playwright locators
- Complex CSS selectors scattered throughout test files
- No reusable UI interaction patterns
- Difficult maintenance when UI changes

### Current Direction
- Component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Encapsulated locators within components
- Standardized API for UI interactions
- Parameterized components for flexible usage

### Future Considerations
- Integration with existing Page Object Model
- Performance impact of component abstraction
- Training team on new component patterns
- Migration strategy for existing test suite

## Metrics and Validation

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Reduced code duplication in test files
- [ ] Improved test readability and maintainability
- [ ] Faster test development for new features
- [ ] Easier maintenance when UI structure changes

### Validation Plan
1. **Functionality**: Ensure components work with existing tests
2. **Performance**: Verify no significant slowdown in test execution
3. **Usability**: Confirm components are intuitive for test developers
4. **Maintainability**: Test selector changes only require component updates

## Dependencies and Blockers
- **None currently**: All required tools and frameworks are in place
- **Team Adoption**: Will need documentation and examples for team onboarding
