# Project Brief: Xyne Automation

## Overview
This project is an end-to-end automation testing framework for the Xyne application using Playwright and TypeScript.

## Core Requirements
- Comprehensive test automation for web application functionality
- Robust testing framework with reusable components
- Support for functional, smoke, and integration testing
- Advanced features including API monitoring, screenshot capture, and Slack notifications

## Key Goals
1. **Component-Based Testing**: Create reusable test components for UI elements (buttons, text fields, tabs, etc.)
2. **Maintainable Test Structure**: Organize tests in a scalable, modular architecture
3. **Enhanced Reporting**: Provide detailed test reports with screenshots and API monitoring
4. **Cross-Environment Support**: Support testing across different environments and configurations

## Current Focus
Building a component-based testing architecture that allows for:
- Generic UI component classes (Button, TextField, Tab, etc.)
- Application-specific composed components (ChatComponent, LoginComponent, etc.)
- Parameter-driven test execution
- Improved test maintainability and reusability
