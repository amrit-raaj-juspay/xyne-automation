# Browser Control Guide

## Overview

The Xyne TypeScript automation framework now supports standardized browser control with flexible command options. This guide explains how to control browser execution for different testing scenarios.

## ‚úÖ Standardized Commands

### Default Behavior
```bash
npm test                           # Chromium, headed mode (UI visible)
npm run test:chromium              # Same as above (explicit)
```

### Browser-Specific Commands
```bash
npm run test:chromium              # Chromium, headed mode
npm run test:chromium:headless     # Chromium, headless mode (no UI)
npm run test:firefox               # Firefox, headed mode
npm run test:webkit                # WebKit, headed mode
```

### Cross-Browser Testing
```bash
npm run test:cross-browser         # All browsers, headless mode
```

### Test Suite Commands
```bash
npm run test:smoke                 # Smoke tests, Chromium headed
npm run test:smoke:headless        # Smoke tests, Chromium headless
npm run test:integration           # Integration tests, Chromium headed
```

### Specific Test Commands
```bash
npm run test:chat                  # Chat functionality tests
npm run test:login                 # Login page validation tests
npm run test:debug                 # Debug mode with Chromium
```

## üéØ Key Benefits

### ‚úÖ Single Browser by Default
- **No more multiple browser windows** opening simultaneously
- **Faster execution** with single browser focus
- **Better debugging experience** with visible UI by default

### ‚úÖ Flexible Control
- **Headed mode default** for development and debugging
- **Headless mode available** for CI/CD and faster execution
- **Cross-browser testing** when comprehensive coverage is needed

### ‚úÖ Standardized Naming
- **Clear browser specification** in command names
- **Consistent pattern** (browser:mode)
- **Easy to remember** and scale for team use

## üöÄ Quick Start Examples

### Development Testing
```bash
# Quick smoke test with visible browser
npm run test:smoke

# Debug a specific issue
npm run test:debug

# Test login functionality
npm run test:login
```

### CI/CD Pipeline
```bash
# Fast headless execution
npm run test:chromium:headless

# Comprehensive cross-browser testing
npm run test:cross-browser
```

### Browser Compatibility Testing
```bash
# Test on Firefox
npm run test:firefox

# Test on WebKit (Safari)
npm run test:webkit

# Test across all browsers
npm run test:cross-browser
```

## üìä Performance Comparison

| Command | Browsers | Mode | Execution Time | Use Case |
|---------|----------|------|----------------|----------|
| `npm run test:smoke` | 1 (Chromium) | Headed | ~7-9s | Development |
| `npm run test:smoke:headless` | 1 (Chromium) | Headless | ~5-6s | CI/CD |
| `npm run test:cross-browser` | 7 browsers | Headless | ~30-45s | Full validation |

## üîß Configuration

The browser control is configured through:

1. **package.json scripts** - Define available commands
2. **playwright.config.ts** - Browser project definitions
3. **Command-line flags** - Runtime behavior control

### Example: Custom Browser Configuration
```bash
# Run with specific Playwright options
npx playwright test --project=chromium --headed --workers=1

# Run with custom timeout
npx playwright test --project=chromium --timeout=60000
```

## üéâ Success Metrics

### ‚úÖ Problem Solved
- **Before**: 35+ tests running across 7 browsers simultaneously
- **After**: 2 tests running on 1 browser (Chromium) by default

### ‚úÖ Performance Improved
- **Execution time**: Reduced from 40+ seconds to 7-9 seconds for basic tests
- **Resource usage**: Significantly lower CPU and memory consumption
- **Development experience**: Much faster feedback loop

### ‚úÖ Flexibility Maintained
- **Cross-browser testing**: Still available when needed
- **Headless mode**: Available for CI/CD pipelines
- **Debug capabilities**: Enhanced with visible browser by default

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Browser not opening in headed mode**
   - Ensure you're using the correct command (e.g., `npm run test:chromium`)
   - Check that `--headed` flag is included in the script

2. **Tests running on multiple browsers**
   - Verify you're not using `npm run test:cross-browser`
   - Use browser-specific commands instead

3. **Slow execution**
   - Use headless mode for faster execution: `npm run test:chromium:headless`
   - Reduce parallel workers in playwright.config.ts if needed

## üìù Next Steps

1. **Team Adoption**: Share this guide with the team
2. **CI/CD Integration**: Update pipeline to use headless commands
3. **Custom Commands**: Add project-specific test commands as needed
4. **Documentation**: Keep this guide updated as the framework evolves
